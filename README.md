s.m- Test File.

1) newton.m- Implementation of Newtons method to find a root of a function f : R → R. The input arguments of the function are initial guess, function f and its derivative.

2) secant.m- Implementation of Secant method to find a root of a function f : R → R. The input arguments of the function are two initial guesses and function f .

3) gebs.m- Implementation of the well known Gauss elimination and Backward substitution method to solve a system of linear equations.

4) LU.m- Implementation of LU Decomposition of a matrix.

5) LL.m- Implementation of Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric positive matrix.

6) SOR.m- Implementation of SOR method with pre-conditioner.

7) ConGrad.m- Implementation of Conjugate gradient method with pre-conditioner.

8) NewtonDD.m- Newton divided difference method to obtain the interpolating value.

9) PLI.m- Piecewise linear interpolation method to obtain the interpolating value.

10) CubicSpline.m- Natural cubic spline method to obtain the interpolating value.
